<h1>Weather APPâ›…</h1>
This is a simple weather app built using HTML, Javascript, Nodejs and ExpressJs. This was built just to show the backend working of the application.
I built this simple app to implement my backend skills.This is a server based application in which the script runs on the server rather than browser (client side).`

<ul>
  <li>Used NodeJs for backend and ExpressJs for server.</li>
  <li>Used Openweathermap's API for fetching live weather data.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Future Enhancements:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Building a frontend and making it a full stack application.</li>
  <li>Use react js to build rich UI.</li>
</ul>
